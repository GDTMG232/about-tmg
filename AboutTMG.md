# About TMG

**I code.**

I dive into Python, JS, TS, and I’m picking up C# to get into .NET and game dev with Unity. Been at it for 3 years with Python, 1 year with JS, and 4 months with TS.

## My Projects

Check out my projects below! I’m particularly pumped about **Quantum**, my Discord Bot. You can learn all about it on its dedicated site ([Quantum Website](https://gdtmg232.github.io/Quantum)), which covers what it does, the commands you can use, and how to reach me for support.

***Heads up: this website will be getting some upgrades soon!***
