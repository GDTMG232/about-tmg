# About TMG

##  Hi there!
My name is TMG, I do coding projects in Python and JavaScript, and I am learning Java, I'm more-or-less focused on Python with my [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1196187116569366608&permissions=8&scope=bot) but that's besides the point. 

I am not taking commissions for coding projects at the moment, and I am focused on my own projects and I am able to talk to you if you'd like to learn how to code in Python, you can join [My Discord Server](https://discord.gg/3EJs7RvjFR) if you'd like to talk to me personally.

## What do you do?
As stated above, I code, but I also make music and play some games

## Why do you code?
<smaller>i never got asked this, mind you</smaller><br>
I just code because I enjoy it and it's a fun pass-time in my opinion

## What do you code?
In Python, I am currently working on a Discord bot ([invite here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1196187116569366608&permissions=8&scope=bot)) and just making silly programs for people to use, like my [YouTube Downloader](https://github.com/gdtmg232/youtube-downloader) and some other projects I use for myself.

I'm learning Java and I've found it relatively fun/easy given I know the basics of most languages, but I'm focused on Java more, *because of minecraft mods lol*.
